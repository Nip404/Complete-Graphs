# Multiplication-Tables
A different way of visualising multiplication in Python 3.x using the Pygame library.
This code was inspired by [Mathologer's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg) video on Youtube.\
You can find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8).

Factor = 103; Density = 8.5%\
Factor = 103; Density = 10.2%\
Factor = 154; Density = 48.45%\
Factor = 2; Density = 12%\
Factor = 31; Density = 4.5%\
Factor = 46; Density = 4.5%\
Factor = 501; Density = 12%\
Factor = 479; Density = 12%\
Factor = 929; Density = 12%\
Factor = 1041; Density = 12%\
Factor = 1041; Density = 12.35%\
Factor = 1041; Density = 15.8%\
Factor = 1053; Density = 3.9%\
Factor = 1063; Density = 36.4%\
Factor = 801; Density = 4%

# Requirements

Download project and run main.py to use.\
Python 3.x and Pygame 1.7.x or above is required.\
You can download pygame either [here](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) or [here](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/).
